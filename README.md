# CLUSTERING LARGE BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE UNITED STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------

![Large Business Owners Clusters](https://github.com/Engr-Daniel/Clustering-Large-Business-Owners-in-the-United-States/assets/103637488/c145d8ad-1486-4661-b4f0-863329e04b19)

Clustering of Large Business Owners in Us Project is to cluster Large business owners based on various attributes. 
Through clustering algorithms, I aim to;
- identify distinct groups within the large business owner population,
- build a clustering model, and
- build an interactive dashboard
- businesses can gain valuable insights, optimize decision-making processes, and drive growth and success in the competitive landscape of large business ownership in the US.

### Applications
- Market Segmentation
- Targeted Marketing Campaigns
- Partnership and Collaboration Opportunities
- Resource Allocation and Planning

### DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[DATA](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/files/scfp2022excel.zip) is from [US FEDERAL RESERVE](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm) Website

The Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) is normally a triennial cross-sectional survey of U.S. families. The survey data include information on familiesâ€™ balance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic characteristics. Information is also included from related surveys of pension providers and the earlier such surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Board. No other study for the country collects comparable information. Data from the SCF are widely used, from analysis at the Federal Reserve and other branches of government to scholarly work at the major economic research centers.


The 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) which is the data for this project is the most recent survey conducted
